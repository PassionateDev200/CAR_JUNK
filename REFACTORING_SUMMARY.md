## Design System Principles Applied

### Typography Hierarchy
```javascript
xs:   12px (0.75rem)  - Fine print
sm:   13px (0.813rem) - Secondary text
base: 14px (0.875rem) - Body text
md:   15px (0.938rem) - Radio labels
lg:   17px (1.063rem) - Subheadings
xl:   20px (1.25rem)  - Main titles
2xl:  24px (1.5rem)   - Large headings
```

### Color Palette
```javascript
Primary:     #0a66c2 (LinkedIn blue)
Success:     #057642 (Green)
Text:        #000000 (Primary), #666666 (Secondary), #9ca3af (Tertiary)
Background:  #ffffff (Primary), #f3f2ef (Secondary), #edf3f8 (Accent)
Border:      #e0dfdc (Primary), #b9d6f2 (Secondary), #0a66c2 (Focus)
Error:       #d32f2f
Warning:     #f59e0b
```

### Spacing System
- Based on 8px grid (MUI spacing units)
- Consistent padding: 16px, 24px, 32px
- Margins: 8px, 16px, 24px
- Gap between elements: 16px

### Visual Elements
- **Border Radius:** 8px (sm), 16px (md), 24px (lg)
- **Shadows:** Subtle layered shadows for depth
- **Transitions:** 200ms ease for all interactive elements
- **Borders:** 1-2px solid with neutral colors

## Migration from shadcn/ui to MUI

### Component Mapping
```
shadcn/ui Card → MUI Paper + Box
shadcn/ui Button → MUI Button
shadcn/ui Input → MUI TextField
shadcn/ui Label → MUI Typography + FormControlLabel
shadcn/ui Alert → MUI Alert
shadcn/ui Dialog → MUI Dialog
shadcn/ui RadioGroup → MUI RadioGroup
shadcn/ui Checkbox → MUI Checkbox
```

### Styling Approach
- **Before:** Tailwind CSS classes + shadcn/ui variants
- **After:** MUI `sx` prop with theme tokens

---

## Theme Overrides (Optional Enhancement)

To apply these styles globally, you can add to your MUI theme provider:

```javascript
import { createTheme, ThemeProvider } from '@mui/material/styles';
import { muiQuestionTheme } from '@/theme/questionTheme';

const theme = createTheme({
  ...muiQuestionTheme,
  palette: {
    primary: {
      main: '#0a66c2',
    },
    success: {
      main: '#057642',
    },
  },
});

// Wrap your app with:
<ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
  {/* Your app */}
</ThemeProvider>
```

---

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Visual Testing:**
   - Verify all question components render correctly
   - Check color consistency across all states
   - Test responsive behavior on mobile/tablet/desktop

2. **Interaction Testing:**
   - Test radio button selections
   - Verify input validation (ZipCode, Mileage)
   - Test vehicle quadrant selector
   - Verify navigation (Previous/Next buttons)

3. **Accessibility Testing:**
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - Color contrast ratios
   - Focus indicators

4. **Integration Testing:**
   - Test data flow between questions
   - Verify pricing calculations
   - Test disqualification scenarios
   - Check modal interactions

---

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Create Global MUI Theme:**
   - Centralize all MUI overrides in a single theme file
   - Apply theme consistently across the entire application

2. **Add Animation Library:**
   - Framer Motion is already integrated
   - Add micro-interactions for enhanced UX

3. **Responsive Optimization:**
   - Fine-tune mobile layouts
   - Add tablet-specific breakpoints

4. **Dark Mode Support:**
   - Extend theme with dark mode palette
   - Add theme toggle functionality

## Files Summary

**Created:** 2 files
- `src/theme/questionTheme.js`
- `src/components/quote/questions/QuestionLayout.jsx`

**Modified:** 18 files
- `src/components/quote/VehicleConditionWizard.jsx`
- All 17 question component files

**Total Lines Changed:** ~8,000+ lines
